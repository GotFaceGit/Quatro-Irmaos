### Description
##### This is a hybrid game. It looks like Connect Four. It behaves like Tic-Tac-Toe. The difference is, the game relieves the players from the physical world limitations of having to build up to create a win. It allows the player to play anywhere. This creates a slightly different win strategy than what is needed for Connect Four or Tic-Tac-Toe.
